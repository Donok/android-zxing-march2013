  /** Omar Khote - P09289338 -  APPENDIX P - Android proof of concept, QR-barcode reader**/

        Note: The application is incomplete. The '.apk' executable, was not created due to this.


      The project fails to invoke the QR-code scanner and scan a barcode. The conlusion of why this occurs, is 
      due to perhaps being a bug in the ZXING library.

  This project contains 2 zip files, 
      The 1st file is Zxing-2don_k.zip , this is the ZXING library ( which was invoked via the method mentioned here:
      http://mukeshyadav4u.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/integrating-zxing-qr-code-scanner-into.html

      The 2nd file is android.zip ( This contains the main code of the application). This file call's the 1'st file as
      a library.

      


    ( The java build path used for the project was created from version 2.1 of ZXING's library.
